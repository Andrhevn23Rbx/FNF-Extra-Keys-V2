go into the songs folder, add a new folder for your song name, stick in the inst and voices,
now go to data folder, open freeplaySonglist.txt, add a new line and put Songname:charactername:weeknumber
the song name is not case sensitve in this txt file, but please use lower case everywhere else besides here and the json file

also difficulties are automatic in freeplay, so you can literally add as many charts as you want and it will work
