go into the songs folder, add a new folder for your song name, stick in the inst and voices,
now go to data folder, open freeplaySonglist.txt, add a new line and put Songname:charactername:weeknumber
the song name is not case sensitve in this txt file, but please use lower case everywhere else besides here and the json file
then go into the charts folder and make a folder for the song name, stick in your charts and you should be good to go

also difficulties are automatic in freeplay, so you can literally add as many charts as you want and it will work
