so this engine uses new stage system i made, currently CAN'T make custom ones without hardcoding it

so to start you wanna go into stagePiece.hx, and add a case for every sprite used in the stage,
you can copy paste the examples i set up to use for your own pieces, 
danceable stage pieces mean you can make them do something every beat (for example, play bop animation)

once you done that go into playstate.hx, search for pieceArray, you should fine the big case statement
for the stages, so firstly you wanna go up and look for the SONG.stage case statement, stick in your song name
for your stage in case it doesnt work properly (it probably will), 
now you wanna add in a case for your stage inside the stageCheck case statement, to do this you wanna first 
set the stage name, then add a line for the pieceArray, in the array, you wanna stick in the stage piece names
in the add order (it goes from left to right, this is the layering order), you can then set the stage offsets for
each character, look at some of the other stages for examples


also btw you dont have to use this stage system if you dont like it, just do stageExpecption = true; inside your case
