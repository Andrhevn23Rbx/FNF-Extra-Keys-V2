guess i should start doing this



0.5 ///////////////////////////////////////////////

- fixed sustains not appearing properly in chart editor

- sustains in chart editor are now colored based on the note

- hscript modchart support (uses actual haxe code so almost anything can be done)

- added a song slider in the chart editor for easily getting around the song

- you can now grab a note with right click in the chart editor to pull out a sustain from it (will appear when let go)

- ctrl z,x,c,v,a,s support in chart editor

- note quantization support (up to 6144th lol)

- note quant snaps in chart editor (press Tab)

- strumline angling and note incoming direction angling

- support for extra characters (done by adding character names to an array with a modchart)

- options to toggle gf strums in chart editor (kinda like how it works in applecore, strums will float above gf)


code stuff most people wont care about

- added a player class for reducing duplicated code

- cleaned up keybind code

- cleaned up the note color code a bit

- now requires you to install some more libraries

haxelib install hscript-ex
